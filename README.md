# Frontend
I chose Angular as the frontend due to never actually using angular before, since hiwaldo is utilizing Angular, I though now would be a great time to get my hands dirty with this tech test.

I can say this is not my best work, I wanted to include a store, which pushes users to an array if the guid is not present in the store. The goal was to show a small list of users by name and company, when a user clicks on the user angular router would open up a user profile.

Upon experiencing difficulty with angulars http module, I decided to scrap that idea and go with something more basic, just to learn angular and still show case some of my skill.

It has taken me 3 hours to get to this point so far and I could spend all day on this, but I am now moving onto the backed test.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.
Utilising bootstrap v4 css for styling.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
